;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains "autoloads" for `auto-mode-alist' and some
;; variables that are used by regexps.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defvar guix-store-directory "/gnu/store"
  "Name of the Guix store directory.
See Info node `(guix) The Store'.

This string is used in various regular expressions and it
shouldn't end with a trailing slash.")

;;;###autoload
(defvar guix-hash-regexp
  ;; Hash-parts do not include "e", "o", "u" and "t".  See base32Chars
  ;; at <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/src/libutil/hash.cc>
  (rx (= 32 (any "0-9" "a-d" "f-n" "p-s" "v-z")))
  "Regexp matching hash part of a store file name.")

;;;###autoload
(unless (rassq 'guix-build-log-mode auto-mode-alist)
  ;; The purpose of this ^^^ check is to avoid running this sexp twice:
  ;; if `auto-mode-alist' contains some guix mode, then most likely this
  ;; sexp has already been evaluated by "autoloads.el".
