;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-Guix (aka "guix.el") provides featureful visual interface for
;; the GNU Guix package manager.  It allows you:
;;
;; - to search for packages and to look at their code (package recipes);
;;
;; - to manage your Guix profile(s) by installing/removing packages;
;;
;; - to look at, compare and remove profile generations;
;;
;; - to do many other things.
;;
;; Run "M-x guix-help" to look at the summary of available commands.

;;; Code:

(defgroup guix nil
  "Interface for the GNU Guix package manager."
  :prefix "guix-"
  :group 'external)

(defgroup guix-faces nil
  "Guix faces."
  :group 'guix
  :group 'faces)

(defface guix-true
  '((default :weight bold)
    (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light))
     :foreground "ForestGreen")
    (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark))
     :foreground "PaleGreen")
    (((class color) (min-colors 8))
     :foreground "green")
    (t :underline t))
  "Parent face for various true-kind things ('Yes' strings, etc.)."
  :group 'guix-faces)

(defface guix-false
  '((t :weight bold))
  "Parent face for various false-kind things ('No' strings, etc.)."
