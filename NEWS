* Changes in 0.2 (since Emacs-Guix was a part of Guix)

** User visible changes

*** New commands

**** M-x guix-help

**** M-x guix-profiles

*** "P" key to display packages

Previously, "RET" was used in various lists to display packages.  Now it
is not the case in lists of generations and licenses ("RET" is used to
display Info buffer), but "P" can be used anywhere (in lists of
generations, licenses, locations and profiles).

*** Package List

"C-u ^" marks all installed packages (even not obsolete) for upgrading.

*** Generation List

New column with a number of packages is added.

*** Generation Info

Several new parameters and buttons are added (especially in Info buffer
for system generations).

*** 'guix-build-log-minor-mode' is not activated by default

To activate it, use:

(add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'guix-build-log-minor-mode)

*** 'guix-devel-mode' is not activated by default

To activate it, use:

(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'guix-devel-mode)

*** New variables

- guix-repl-use-latest: defines whether or not to use "guix pull"-ed
  code (default is t).

*** Renamed variables

guix-use-guile-server           -> guix-repl-use-server
guix-after-start-repl-hook      -> guix-repl-after-start-hook
guix-after-repl-operation-hook  -> guix-repl-after-operation-hook
guix-before-repl-operation-hook -> guix-repl-before-operation-hook
guix-ui-update-after-operation  -> guix-update-buffers-after-operation

*** Renamed buffers

"List" part was removed from buffer names (*Guix Packages* instead of
*Guix Package List*, etc.)

** Internal changes

*** Guile code is split into multiple modules

Previously, there was a single "guix-main.scm" file with the code for
all the features.  Now there are several Guile modules which are loaded
on demand.  This improves the start time of the Guix REPL, especially
for those commands that do not require to load many Guix modules (like
"M-x guix-licenses").

*** Guile load path is augmented on the Emacs-Lisp side

Previously, there was "guix-helper.scm" file (generated by
"./configure") that set up the required load-path and loaded
"guix-main.scm".  Now this is done on the elisp side, which is more
versatile as it also allows to use Emacs-Guix from MELPA or from source
without additional configuration.

*** Renamed files

guix-backend.el  -> guix-repl.el
guix-base.el     -> guix-misc.el
guix-messages.el -> guix-ui-messages.el

*** Removed files

**** guix-buffer.el, guix-entry.el, guix-history.el, guix-info.el, guix-list.el

Now BUI library is used for list/info interfaces, so a big part of elisp
code was removed (the removed code was used as the base for BUI
library).

**** guix-emacs.el

This file stays in Guix as it is used in Emacs package recipe (it is
intended to autoload Emacs packages installed with Guix).

**** guix-init.el

It was deprecated in Guix since March 2016.

*** Requirements

Required Geiser version updated to 0.8.
New requirements: "bui.el" and "dash.el" libraries.
