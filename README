* About

=Emacs-Guix= (aka =guix.el=) provides various features and tools
for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][GNU Guix]] package manager.

It allows you to manage your Guix profile(s) from Emacs: to install,
upgrade and remove packages, to switch and remove profile generations,
to display all available info about packages and to do many other
things.

This README provides only a basic overview on Emacs-Guix, for a full and
detailed description, see the info manual that comes with it.

In short, Emacs-Guix provides the following features:

- Interface for:

  + profiles

  + profile generations (including system generations for GuixSD)

  + packages

  + package licenses

  + package locations

  + [[https://hydra.gnu.org][Hydra build farm]]

- Magit-like popup interface for all guix shell commands (=M-x guix=).

- Modes to view logs of package builds (=guix-build-log-mode= and
  =guix-build-log-minor-mode=).

- Minor mode to "prettify" store file names (to replace hash parts with
  "…").

- Shell completions for all guix commands and options (for =M-x shell=
  and =M-x eshell=).

- Minor mode with additional functionality for =scheme-mode= to work
  with Guix .scm files, particularly with package modules
  (=guix-devel-mode=).

On the following screenshot you can see one of the mentioned features,
namely: "list" and "info" interface for Guix packages (this screenshot
was made for an early version of Emacs-Guix, the interface has slightly
changed since then).
